# mcsetup
A Minecraft Server setup script to be used on Ubuntu servers 

## How to Use Me

This script is intended to help you set up your own minecraft server
with ease. It was originally written for use on a [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com) 
linux server instance so I recommend using their machines in order to run
this script.

Setup is really simple:

1. Log in to your paperspace machine and type **https://github.com/ArtBears/mcsetup.git**
2. Then change into the downloaded file with **cd mcsetup**
3. Then run ./mincraft.sh and put in your machine password when prompted.

Your Server should now be running! You can access it from mincraft using your public IP
listed on your Paperspace machine description page.
